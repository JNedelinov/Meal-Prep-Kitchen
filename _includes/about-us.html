    <h2>More About Us</h2>
    <p>21st Century - everything is so fast and our schedules so full of things to do 'when we get home', things we should do at work, at the gym etc. etc. That is why our CEO, Julien Nedelinov, created Meal - Prep Kitchen: to provide everything you need to stay in physical and mental balance, combining your professional and personal lives at one, to spend more time with the family and in the nature. At Meal - Prep Kitchen we believe in that <strong>'time matters' </strong>and that it should <strong>NOT</strong> be wasted, because <strong>WE</strong> all have dreams and goals to accomplish!</p>
    <p>The project just started (11th of May) this year. Even though we are still so young, we all have big goals and we will not dissapoint you. We even created pretty good relationships with a few of our clients (could see them on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/home" style="text-decoration: none; color: yellowgreen; font-weight: bold;">home</a> page).</p>
    <p>At Meal - Prep Kitchen we are active defenders of the Mother Earth. With that said, we are 100% against the plastic and you will <strong>NEVER</strong> see us using plastic boxes for our meals. 1st - because the plastic polution is main killer of the Earth and 2nd - because the plastic literally kills all of the flavours and when the food is put while still hot, the plastic releases chemicals which are deadly for most of the living creatures, including us!</p>
