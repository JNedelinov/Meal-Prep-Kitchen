# Meal-Prep-Kitchen
TestSite02 repository. Hopefully that one won't stop working... :/


# The Idea 

Basically this repository is based on an idea of changing the people's lifestyles.

The idea is to give our customers more free time to spend enjoying with their families and loved ones and to stop worrying about making food.

It is a combination of work and enjoying the fruits of the our labor because we give the chance of people to work from their homes or in our restaurant based in Sofia, Bulgaria.

We do have an office where the IT magic happens and where we connect with our current and future customers

# What I've used in the creating of the website

 - HTML5;
 - CSS3;
 - Jekyll;
 - Github;
 - node.js and it's DevDependencies: 
 
    "browser-sync": "^2.26.3",
    "child_process": "^1.0.2",
    "gulp": "^4.0.2",
    "gulp-autoprefixer": "^6.0.0",

    "node-sass": "^4.12.0"

 - JavaScript which comes with the node.js.

# About the requirements:

I have covered all of the requirements except using MIXIN.

I have worked alone the whole time but after today (15.08.2019), if the idea is something new for you, then hit me up, and we may do something about making all that possible!


Thank you! 

(i could do a better job at writing the readme file lol)
